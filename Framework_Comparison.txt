Ray is the most efficient platform overall for quick training and 
low memory usage, making it ideal for applications where speed and 
resource efficiency are critical.

TensorFlow is best for scenarios where maximum throughput is needed, 
especially with larger datasets. Apache Spark MLlib is a good compromise 
for distributed training scenarios where moderate performance suffices. 
PyTorch Distributed is less efficient in this comparison and may require 
optimization or alternative configurations.

However, for resource scalability, TensorFlow Distributed is the best 
performer in this experiment considering speed, accuracy, and GPU utilization. 
On the other hand, for tasks requiring low communication overhead, PyTorch is 
the best option. Apache could be suitable for workloads where asynchronous performance 
is critical for larger datasets, but it may not be ideal for latency-sensitive tasks.

Apache Spark showed the weakest fault tolerance in this experiment. 
Whereas,  best fault tolerance was demonstrated by TensorFlow Distributed.
